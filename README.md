This application is built using React, Vite, and TypeScript, offering a customizable stepper component that guides users through a sequence of steps. It's designed to be flexible, allowing you to define titles, steps, and their states with ease.

## Features

- Flexible Step Content: Encapsulate custom content for each step as children of the stepper component. It's also possible to use the stepper as a state viewer without displaying the child content.

- Validation Support: Steps can interact with a `setValidateStep` property, enabling you to define custom validation or processing before a user can proceed or complete a step.
